# Hi, I'm Maedeh 👋  
**Junior Front-End Developer (React-focused)**

I'm a junior front-end developer with a strong foundation in core web technologies and a growing focus on React.  
Although I haven't worked in a formal professional role yet, I actively build projects, practice consistently, and use GitHub as my main learning and portfolio platform.

My goal is to grow into a reliable front-end developer and contribute to real-world products in a professional team environment.
